# Data-Mining-Project-1
CSCI 4370 Team Project 1 part 1 description

Objective:
1. Implement classification algorithm in coding form
2. Familiar with a real world data as input dataset
3. Simulate a research environment
Requirements:
Part1. Please implement one of the classification algorithms introduced in the class
(Decision tree, Naïve Bayes or KNN) in any programming language your team chooses.
Perform the prediction of whether a wine can achieve 90+ based on their sensory
reviews. Apply the chosen algorithm on the training dataset and predict the label for the
testing dataset given in the project.
Part2. Compare the predicted result with the true label in the testing dataset. Calculate
the prediction accuracy (#corrected predicted wine/#total wine in testing dataset).
Part3. Implement SVM using SVM light on the training dataset and make predictions on
the testing dataset. The SVM topic will be discussed in the next class. Also calculate the
prediction accuracy and compare with part2.
 Due day: Given in the Blackboard
I will arrange online meetings using online support link with each team. All team
members are expected to join the meeting. During the meeting, I will take a look your
program and the prediction results. We will discuss your results and have one more step
of programming/improvement/discussion as follow up project (one week after the due
day). Please prepare your testing dataset in the format of:
Real grade Predicted grade
1 1
1 1
1 0
0 0
0 1
…
You are encouraged to send team members to join the online support next week so that I
can make sure your team is on the right track.
