# Data-Mining-Project-1
CSCI 4370 Team Project 1 part 1 description

Objective:

      1. Implement classification algorithm in coding form
      3. Familiar with a real world data as input datase
      5. Simulate a research environment

Requirements:

      Part1:
            Implement one of the classification algorithms introduced in the class (Decision tree, Naïve Bayes or KNN) in any programming language your team chooses. 
            Perform the prediction of whether a wine can achieve 90+ based on their sensory reviews. Apply the chosen algorithm on the training dataset and predict the label for the testing dataset given in the project.
      Part2: 
            Compare the predicted result with the true label in the testing dataset. Calculate the prediction accuracy (#corrected predicted wine/#total wine in testing dataset).
      Part3: 
            Implement SVM using SVM light on the training dataset and make predictions on the testing dataset. The SVM topic will be discussed in the next class. Also calculate the prediction accuracy and compare with part2.
